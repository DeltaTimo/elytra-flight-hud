## Contribution

The code is a mess currently. It was intended to be an experiment and after hours of trying to render a simple line this is the frustrated and piled code result. The results were too good not to share, so here they are. I would probably have to lie if I said plans are to refactor the code eventually, but there is a chance I will.
